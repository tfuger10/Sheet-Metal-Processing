# Sheet Metal Part Classification using Neural Networks

## Project Overview

Our client "Manufacturers Connected" is a software company delivering an online software platform for small to medium sized manufacturers. They are working on a "manufacturer's social network" (or a manufacturer's community) where manufacturers within the United States can create a profile on the network detailing their capabilities as well as connect with other manufacturers on the network. The manufacturer can list their specific machine capabilities and buyers can reach out to them through the network.

The client would like to add a feature where users upload a 3D STEP model or drawing of their part and an algorithm will identify the required manufacturing processes to make that part. By identifying the required processes, the platform could recommend the manufacturers within the closest distance that could provide these services based on the capabilities required. By automating this identification, user search queries for capabilities would be reduced thus resulting in an uptick in user engagement and audience growth. Given that the platform is a subscription service, the growth in user base will result in a growth of sales for the client.

This project is one segment of the longer term project mentioned above. This project focuses on tackling the following swath of the overall projectidentifying manufacturing processes required on forming of sheet metal parts. The input used will be 3D STEP models.


They would like to boost the automation and efficiency in the engineering department by automating the process of assigning all bending. This project used a dataset of STEP models of about 8000 different parts supplied by the company to train a Pytorch nueral network to predict manufacturing process assignment for parts.



## Business Understanding

### Business Problem




> Our stakeholder is looking to **increase platform user base** by **automatically identifying the manufacturing process** for a custom fabricated **sheet metal part**.



### Parent Objective

> To develop a **Convolutional Neural Network** that can properly **identify the required processes** for each **3D modeled part.**

### Long Term Goal

This project is the first in a series of planned projects working towards a long term goal of creating a system which can automatically identify and program parts for various assemblies. This in turn will reduce the amount of engineering time required for each project, and will free the team up to focus on other responsibilities. This project is the catalyst and will classify the first step in the manufacturing process for each of the parts.
